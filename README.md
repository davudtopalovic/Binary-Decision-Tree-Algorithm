# Decision-Tree-Algorithm

In this repository you can find following files:
1. pdf file: Decision Tree Classification in Python.pdf which is a seminary paper (in progress) that explains the concept and math behind Decision Tree Algorithm 
2. Jupyter notebook file that consists the code of our Decision Tree Algorithm as well as it's application on two different datasets. 
3. First dataset: iris_data.csv
4. Second dataset: iphone_purchase_records.csv

Here we don't use any library that has predefined code for implementing Decision Trees, instead we code DTC completely from scratch using only libraries such as numpy and pandas.
